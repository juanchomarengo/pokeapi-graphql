# Pokemon App

**Approximate Duration**: 1-2 weeks

## Overview
Create an application that serves as a visual database for Pokémon. This application should display all Pokémon, including the following data:
- Name
- Image
- Evolutions
- Choose 4 additional pieces of data. At least one piece of data should involve making another API call (e.g., moves), and one piece of data should be a list of elements.

The application should have a list showcasing all the Pokémon, with a link to each Pokémon's detail page. You need to provide a page for the general list and a new page that functions as the detail page (including necessary navigation). Any extra additions will be appreciated, such as:
- Adding a link to evolution from the Pokémon detail page
- Adding animations and unique styling
- Adding a loader
